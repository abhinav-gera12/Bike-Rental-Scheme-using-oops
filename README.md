# Project Bike Rental System using OOPs concept
1) Display the total Stock of bikes
2) User can request the bike and total quantity should be added which calculates the total payment
   If a person rent 3 bikes and per bike costs is 1000 so, the user needs to pay 3000 for 3 bikes
3) Tell the rest of bikes that are in stock so that, if the user is interested then he will rent it more accordingly.
